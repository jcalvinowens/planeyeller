planeyeller.py
==============

This is a simplistic Python script which uses dump1090 and espeak to announce
airplanes flying overhead. There's no reason it shouldn't be portable, but it
has only been tested on Linux and FreeBSD.

The script requires dump1090 (or any of its forks), and espeak:

	$ apt install espeak dump1090-mutability # Debian, Ubuntu
	$ pkg install espeak dump1090 # FreeBSD

Once those are installed, connect an RTL-SDR, and run the script:

	$ ./planeyeller.py --lat XX.XXXXX --lon YYY.YYYYY --alt ZZZZ --live

The latitude, longitude, and altitude are that of the observer who will be
listening to the announcements, not the receiver or antenna. By default,
airplanes are announced when they are 45 degrees above the horizon. Any
desired angle can be specified with "--angle", including negative angles.

A set of simple testcases are provided in /tests.
